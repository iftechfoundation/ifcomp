<h2>Email addresses</h2>
<p>This is a simple list of all email addresses for all authors with at least one non-disqualified entry registered with the [% current_comp.year %] IFComp.</p>

<p>You can use this list to e.g. paste into mailing-list software, or just to build a massive bcc: field or whatever if that's your thing.</p>

<h2>Forum handles</h2>

<p>This is a simple list of forum handles addresses for all authors with at least one non-disqualified entry registered with the [% current_comp.year %] IFComp.</p>

<p>Note that it will likely be shorter than the email-address list, because not all authors will set a forum handle for themselves.</p>
