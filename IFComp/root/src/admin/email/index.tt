<h1>Entrant email addresses: [% current_comp.year %]</h1>

<h2>The list</h2>
<p>This is a simple list of all email addresses for all authors with at least one non-disqualified entry registered with the [% current_comp.year %] IFComp.</p>

<p>You can use this list to e.g. paste into mailing-list software, or just to build a massive bcc: field or whatever if that's your thing.</p>
[% IF emails.size > 0 %]
<div class="well">
<p>
[% FOREACH email IN emails %]
[% email %]<br />
[% END %]
</p> 
</div>
[% ELSE %]
<p>...actually, it looks like we don't have any email addresses right now.</p>
[% END %]

[% IF anti_emails.size > 0 %]
<h2>The anti-list</h2>
<p>Furthermore, here is a list of all the email addresses for authors with <em>only</em> disqualified entries for [% current_comp.year %]. You can use this list to mass-unsubscribe addresses from a mailing list you may have made earlier based on pre-deadline intents.</p>
