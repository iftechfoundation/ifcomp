<p>We won't share your login information with anyone, other than the handful of IF community websites that allow ifcomp.org-based logins (i.e. the XYZZY Awards and IntroComp). Logging into these websites will expose your ifcomp.org account name and email address to them, but not your password or any other account information. This information is sent to these sites only upon your voluntarily logging into them.</p>
<p>We may contact you by email in the case of important administrative matters, but will otherwise not email you unexpectedly.
