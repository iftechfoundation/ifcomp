</div>

<p>The Annual Interactive Fiction Competition (IFComp) welcomes all kinds of
text-driven digital stories and games, making them freely available in order to
encourage the creation, play, and discussion of interactive fiction.</p>

<div class="page-header">
<h1 id="thecompinanutshell">How IFComp works, in a nutshell</h1>
</div>

<p>The Interactive Fiction Competition is <a href="[% c.uri_for_action(
'/history/index' ) %]">an annual event begun by passionate hobbyists in
1995</a> to encourage both the creation and the discussion of new interactive
fiction works (also known as <em>IF</em>). While <a href="[% c.uri_for_action(
'/about/if' ) %]">the definition of IF has evolved in the years since then</a>,
the IFComp's format and schedule have remained stable since the 1990s.
Anyone can judge the entries on a one-to-ten scale, and the laurels go to the
entries receiving the best average rating.</p>

<p>The people who participate in the IFComp include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Authors</strong>, who write the best IF works they can, and then
submit them to the comp before the [% current_comp.entries_due.strftime(
'%{month_name} %{day}' ) %] deadline (see the full schedule below). There is no
entry fee, and anyone's allowed to submit up to three entries.</p>

<p><a href="[% c.uri_for_action( '/rules/rules' ) %]#authors">See the full
rules for authors.</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Judges</strong>, who, over a six-week period in October and
November, play as many entries as they can, and give each one they play a score
between 1 and 10. Higher numbers mean a better score; judges are otherwise free
to use any scoring rubric they wish. A game's final score is simply the
average of all scores it has received.</p>

<p>Judging is open to the public (competition organizers excluded); becoming a
judge simply means creating an account on this website, and proceeding to
submit scores for at least five entries during the judging period.</p>

<p><a href="[% c.uri_for_action( '/rules/rules' ) %]#judges">See the full rules
for judges.</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Donors</strong>, who kindly donate prizes to each year's
prize pool. At the end of the competition, and starting with the first-place
winner, authors take turns choosing a prize from the pool, which the donor will
then deliver to the author via whatever medium is appropriate for it. (Judges
or authors may most certainly act as donors, too.)</p>

<p>Prizes can be (and have been) anything from cash to books to food to
professional services, and more. Donors declare their intent by <a

<h2 id="misscongenialityawards">Miss Congeniality Awards</h2>

<p>Since <a href="[% c.uri_for_action( '/comp/comp', 1998 ) %]">the 1998
competition</a>, the IFComp has every year held a secondary contest allowing
the authors of that year's games to vote on one another's entries,
using a ballot similar to the one that the public uses to vote in the main
competition. The three most highly ranked entries by this vote become the
winners of the Miss Congeniality Awards, an honor permanently recorded in <a
href="[% c.uri_for_action( '/comp/last_comp' ) %]">that year's results
listing</a>.</p>

<h2 id="risingstar">Rising Star Award</h2>

<p>
Since the 2021 competition, the IFComp has recognized the highest-rated game by
a first-time entrant in the competition, called the Rising Star Award, which
is permanently recorded in <a href="[% c.uri_for_action( 'comp/last_comp' )
%]">that year's results listing</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="banana">Golden Banana of Discord</h2>

<p>This special award goes every year to the entry with the highest standard
distribution among its ratings &mdash; roughly speaking, the entries with the
most disagreement among those who rated it. <a
href="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Golden_Banana_of_Discord">The IFWiki keeps a
record of every year's GBoD winner</a>, as well as a bit of history about this
prize.</p>
